# CMP-analysis
A data-driven retail zone optimization project using SQL Server, Power BI, and Azure Data Studio.
This project simulates how a home furnishing company e.g. IKEA can analyze customer behavior across different store zones (Living Room, Kitchen, etc.) to optimize layout and improve engagement

## Tools & Workflow Used
This project simulates a realistic data analytics pipeline using three key tools:

- 🗃️ SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
Created the FurnoSpaceDB database
Defined the zone_visits table structure
Populated the table with 50+ rows of simulated data

- ✍️ Azure Data Studio
  Wrote and ran SQL queries for data exploration

  Analyzed visits per zone, average dwell time, and visit trends

  Exported queries and results for visualization and version control

- 📊 Power BI Desktop
   Connected directly to the local SQL Server database

   Built visuals: bar chart, donut chart, line chart

  Created a clean dashboard to present insights interactively

Exported a static version in PDF format
A Power BI dashboard project using SQL Server and Azure Data Studio for retail zone analytics.

## 📊 Key Findings

- 🛒 1. Distribution of Customer Visits Across Zones
All zones (Bedroom, Living Room, Office, Kitchen) received roughly equal visits.

Visit share per zone:

Bedroom – 25.46%

Living Room – 25.19%

Office – 24.78%

Kitchen – 24.57%

Interpretation: Traffic flow is balanced, suggesting effective zone accessibility and layout.

- ⏱️ 2. Average Time Spent per Zone
Avg. dwell time per zone (in minutes):

Living Room – ~20

Office – ~18

Bedroom – ~15

Kitchen – ~14

Insight: Customers spend more time in Living Room and Office zones, indicating higher engagement or product interaction levels.

- 📆 3. Daily Visit Trend
Customer visits increased gradually from May 1 to May 8.

Growth from ~4 visits/day to ~7 visits/day.

Insight: There's a consistent upward trend in store traffic — may reflect increased marketing effectiveness, seasonal demand, or growing interest.

## 💡 Business Implications
Living Room and Office zones offer stronger engagement potential. These areas could be leveraged for promotions or high-margin products.

Kitchen zone may benefit from layout or product range optimization to increase dwell time.

Rising visit trend suggests preparing for higher footfall (e.g., staffing, inventory planning).
