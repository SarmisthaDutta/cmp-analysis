# CMP-analysis
A data-driven retail zone optimization project using SQL Server, Power BI, and Azure Data Studio.
This project simulates how a home furnishing company e.g. IKEA can analyze customer behavior across different store zones (Living Room, Kitchen, etc.) to optimize layout and improve engagement

## Tools & Workflow Used
This project simulates a realistic data analytics pipeline using three key tools:

- 🗃️ SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
Created the FurnoSpaceDB database
Defined the zone_visits table structure
Populated the table with 50+ rows of simulated data

- ✍️ Azure Data Studio
  Wrote and ran SQL queries for data exploration

  Analyzed visits per zone, average dwell time, and visit trends

  Exported queries and results for visualization and version control

- 📊 Power BI Desktop
  Connected directly to the local SQL Server database

  Built visuals: bar chart, donut chart, line chart

Created a clean dashboard to present insights interactively

Exported a static version in PDF format
